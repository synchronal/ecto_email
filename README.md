An `Ecto.Type` for email addresses, using the
[`ex_email`](https://github.com/synchronal/ex_email) library for
validations. When using a database column type interchangeable with
`:string` such as `:text`, `:string`, or `:citext`, this type may be
used in the schema module to provide automatic validation of inputs.
